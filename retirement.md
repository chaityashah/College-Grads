# Retirement

I have to admit, I've strugged a bit with how to organize this.  In particular, the difference between Retirement and Investing.  The only way to have enough money to retire is to invest (or be born wealthy I guess, but then why did you ever work?  Had to wait for the trust fund?).  So, I'm going to try to break it down like this:

* Retirement:  Specific vehicles (not transportation) that you use to make investments.
* Investment:  Discussion on the specific asset classes that you put money into.

## 401(k)
This is the best corporate investing options.  So named for the portion of the US Tax Code it is defined in, as well as a count of the numbers of reasons you don't care why it's named what it is.
You contribute either pre-tax or post-tax money (more details below) with the earnings on the account growing tax free or tax deferred.
Most companies will match a percentage of your salary.  Regardless of anything else, you should do at least that.
You have the option of a Roth or Traditional 401k.  In general I think a Roth is likely going to work out better because over a long period of time, hopefully you'll retire rich.

### Roth vs Traditional
So, which one should you do?  If there were a straightforward answer, the other one would never get mentioned, so it isn't a simple answer.  Essentially what you're trying to figure out is whether or not you'll be in a higher or lower tax bracket when you retire.
#### Traditional
Contributions are pre-tax.  But no one gets away without paying taxes eventually, so you will pay taxes when you withdraw at your tax rate at that time.  (Tax deferred)
* Your bet:  Your tax rate when you retire is going to be lower than your current tax rate.
#### Roth
Contributions are after-tax.  So you've paid your taxes already and you get to withdraw tax free.
* Your bet:  Your tax rate now is lower than it will be when you retire.

Now, there are a few other advantages to a Roth.
* You are not forced to take distributions at 70 1/2 like you are for traditional.  Ok, really, you **are** required to take them if you keep your money in the Roth 401k.  **BUT** if you roll it over into a Roth IRA (why not) it doesn't have this limitation, so you can pass it on to heirs, if you're so lucky.
* You can withdraw your contributions without penalties (but you shouldn't).  Because your money was contributed post-tax, it can be withdrawn without incurring penalties.  At least that's the reason we ascribe to it.  In reality, trying to decipher why anything is anyway in our tax code is a fool's errand.

## Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA)
The above information also applies to IRAs as well, but with further caveats.  Your ability to contribute to an IRA when you also have a work sponsored plan is limited.  They can also be income limited, so pay attention.  This probably falls into the "advanced financial planning" category and beyond the scope of this backgrounder.  You start getting into things like "mega backdoor Roth" which is probably the worst metal band name ever.
