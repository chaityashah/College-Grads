# Retirement
Saving now will set you up for the future in a way you can't make up for later.  Plus I want you to think nice thoughts about me when you retire.  :)  You especially want to do this due to the [power of compounding](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazing-power-of-compound-interest-2014-7)!  You're young.  Take advantage of that long time horizon to make future you love past you.

I haven't looked in detail recently at what we can do through our plan, but this would be a good way to allocate your investments in the 401k.

Yes, they're more than a little boring.  Sorry about that.  But I really believe if you follow these concepts you will be super successful financially and prevent people from taking advantage of you in your financial life (and trust me, plenty of people will try).

**Never Forget!**

Investing is ALWAYS going to be trade-off of two things (plus another):
* Risk
* Return

The higher the risk, the greater the potential return, and vise-versa.
If someone tries to sell you something that is low-risk and high return, walk away.

The other thing that also comes into play is liquidity.  In particular think about things like real-estate which can't be quickly sold, versus cash which doesn't need to be sold.

## 401(k)
This is the best corporate investing options.  So named for the portion of the US Tax Code it is defined in, as well as a count of the numbers of reasons you don't care why it's named what it is.
You contribute either pre-tax or post-tax money (more details below) with the earnings on the account growing tax free or tax deferred.
Most companies will match a percentage of your salary.  Regardless of anything else, you should do at least that.
You have the option of a Roth or Traditional 401k.  In general I think a Roth is likely going to work out better because over a long period of time, hopefully you'll retire rich.

### Roth vs Traditional
So, which one should you do?  If there were a straightforward answer, the other one would never get mentioned, so it isn't a simple answer.  Essentially what you're trying to figure out is whether or not you'll be in a higher or lower tax bracket when you retire.
#### Traditional
Contributions are pre-tax.  But no one gets away without paying taxes eventually, so you will pay taxes when you withdraw at your tax rate at that time.  (Tax deferred)
* Your bet:  Your tax rate when you retire is going to be lower than your current tax rate.
#### Roth
Contributions are after-tax.  So you've paid your taxes already and you get to withdraw tax free.
* Your bet:  Your tax rate now is lower than it will be when you retire.

Now, there are a few other advantages to a Roth.
* You are not forced to take distributions at 70 1/2 like you are for traditional.  Ok, really, you **are** required to take them if you keep your money in the Roth 401k.  **BUT** if you roll it over into a Roth IRA (why not) it doesn't have this limitation, so you can pass it on to heirs, if you're so lucky.
* You can withdraw your contributions without penalties (but you shouldn't).  Because your money was contributed post-tax, it can be withdrawn without incurring penalties.  At least that's the reason we ascribe to it.  In reality, trying to decipher why anything is anyway in our tax code is a fool's errand.


## Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA)
The above information also applies to IRAs as well, but with further caveats.  Your ability to contribute to an IRA when you also have a work sponsored plan is limited.  They can also be income limited, so pay attention.  This probably falls into the "advanced financial planning" category and beyond the scope of this backgrounder.  You start getting into things like "mega backdoor Roth" which is probably the worst metal band name ever.

## What should I invest in?

You should invest in the assets that aren't going to make you a nervous wreck.  Different people have different tolerances for risk.  
* Index funds

Yes.  These have low fees and if you choose the standard stock indices (S&P500, Large Cap, etc...) they have historically good returns.

* Target date

Also yes.  These work by you setting a date that you expect to want to get the money.  They will automatically rebalance the portfolio over time from high return investments to low risk investments so that you get the advantages of growth with planned stability at the end.
* Low fees

When in doubt, choose the options with low fees.  Fees come straight off of your return.  Thus a fund that is under .25% will perform significantly better than one that is 2% because of math.

### Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)
You should do this!

There may be no such thing as a free lunch, but I'm not sure how much closer this can get.  You enroll and contribute (the maximum you can if you're smart) money for a 6 month period.  At the end of that period you get stock at 85% (or a 15% discount) on the lowest of the price at the beginning or end of the offering period1.   This means you are virtually guaranteed at least a 15% gross return every 6 months and given that it's the lowest, likely even more.  Even at the highest tax rates you'll be over 10% net.  There is nothing else that you can do that is this safe with a return anywhere close.

But!

In order to be smart about this you have to sell immediately!  You already have so much of your financial health tied up in the company, don't be foolish and do it here too.  Take your 15% and invest it in an index or target date fund to diversify.
