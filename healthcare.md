# Healthcare (or Health Care or "Wow, I hate this")

One of the first questions "What is up with all these confusing options?"

Congratulations, you're young.  That means you probably don't have a lot of medical conditions that you have to worry about.  Pieces haven't started falling off and Boy Scouts aren't offering to shepherd you across the street.  But, now that you are adulting, you should consider things like:

* Annual physicals
* Dental care
* Being able to see

## Medical

The U.S. medical system is a marvel among industrialized countries.  No other country comes even close to us for the amount of money we spend and the outcomes we get from it.  Sadly, it's because they all spend way less money and get way better outcomes, but hey, how am I ever going to get elected telling the truth?

### General considerations
Medical generally falls into two categories (but now there is a third one.  yay.)

#### Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)
* Good news: A PPO allows you to go to any doctor without a referral.  This is awesome because it doesn't mean that you're bottlenecked on first seeing your Primary Care Physician (PCP), getting a referral, then going.
* Bad news: It is more expensive.  Co-pays (the amount you pay at each visit) are higher and your maximum out-of-pocket for a year also tend to be higher.

#### Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)
* Good news:  Lower copays.  Lower annual costs.
* Bad news:  You have to choose a PCP (sadly, not the recreational drug, but instead a Primary Care Physician) and then go to that person first for all visits to specialists.

##### Consumer Directed Health Savings Plan (CDHSP)

Just to prove itâ€™s possible to create a more useless abbreviation, we have CDHSP.  
This is the new one, so I need to update it more.

### Finding a Doctor
The same way you do anything else nowadays.  Research on the internet and ask co-workers if they have someone they particularly like.

##### Anecdote
I started out with a PPO when it was just my wife and myself.  The flexibility was awesome.  However, when the Powers family started to grow we looked at the expense of having our first child and an HMO saved us ~$3k in a single year, so we switched and haven't gone back.

## Dental
Almost everyone has teeth.  Almost all dental plans will not cover you fully for any major problems and your options are limited.  Choose one, *BUT* make sure you start getting dental cleanings every six months.  Dental health is a keystone health issue.  It is predictive and causal for increased problems things like heart disease, stroke and chewing solid food.

Sometimes there are different plans with slightly different options.  Normally it's about whether or not the plan covers braces (a.k.a. orthodonics).  If you're not getting them, or you don't have kids getting them in the next year, probably go with the less expensive one.

## Vision
Much like dental, there aren't any great options and it's just about reducing your overall costs.   

Sometimes there are different plans that cover things like LASIK.  If you're going to get that done, then maybe consider that plan.  If you're not, well then, maybe you'll figure out your other options
