# Information for Recent College Graduates

The information in here started when I had several RCGs that were starting to work for me.  Now, some of it was very specific to the company I was working for, but over time, it because a document that people were referring to for a lot of different things, primarily due to the finance information/opinions in it.

Then it grew to the point where I decided it probably needed to be crowdsourced, but the discussion was how.  And now we have it on Github.

# Overview
I graduated so long ago that the basics of how to incorporate into corporate America are so second nature that I forget about all the questions I had at the time.  So, here are the thoughts that I find myself distilling down for my RCGs when they join the team.

**Note:** These are my opinions.  Other people might have different ones.  Maybe people like you, so make sure you do your own research and, when in doubt, ask someone who does this stuff for a living.

### Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)
You should do this!

There may be no such thing as a free lunch, but I'm not sure how much closer this can get.  You enroll and contribute (the maximum you can if you're smart) money for a 6 month period.  At the end of that period you get stock at 85% (or a 15% discount) on the lowest of the price at the beginning or end of the offering period1.   This means you are virtually guaranteed at least a 15% gross return every 6 months and given that it's the lowest, likely even more.  Even at the highest tax rates you'll be over 10% net.  There is nothing else that you can do that is this safe with a return anywhere close.

But!

In order to be smart about this you have to sell immediately!  You already have so much of your financial health tied up in the company, don't be foolish and do it here too.  Take your 15% and invest it in an index or target date fund to diversify.
