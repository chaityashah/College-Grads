# Information for Recent College Graduates

The information in here started when I had several RCGs that were starting to work for me.  Now, some of it was very specific to the company I was working for, but over time, it because a document that people were referring to for a lot of different things, primarily due to the finance information/opinions in it.

Then it grew to the point where I decided it probably needed to be crowdsourced, but the discussion was how.  And now we have it on Github.

# Overview
I graduated so long ago that the basics of how to incorporate into corporate America are so second nature that I forget about all the questions I had at the time.  So, here are the thoughts that I find myself distilling down for my RCGs when they join the team.
Note: These are my opinions.  Other people might have different ones.  Maybe people like you, so make sure you do your own research and, when in doubt, ask someone who does this stuff for a living.

# Health care
One of the first questions "What is up with all these confusing options?"
Congratulations, you're young.  That means you probably don't have a lot of medical conditions that you have to worry about.  Pieces haven't started falling off and Boy Scouts aren't offering to shepherd you across the street.  But, now that you are adulting, you should consider things like:
* Annual physicals
* Dental care
* Being able to see

## Medical
### General considerations
Medical generally falls into two categories (but now there is a third one.  yay.)

#### Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)
* Good news: A PPO allows you to go to any doctor without a referral.  This is awesome because it doesn't mean that you're bottlenecked on first seeing your Primary Care Physician (PCP), getting a referral, then going.
* Bad news: It is more expensive.  Co-pays (the amount you pay at each visit) are higher and your maximum out-of-pocket for a year also tend to be higher.

#### Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)
* Good news:  Lower copays.  Lower annual costs.
* Bad news:  You have to choose a PCP (sadly, not the recreational drug) and then go to that person first for all visits to specialists.

##### Consumer Directed Health Savings Plan (CDHSP)

Just to prove itâ€™s possible to create a more useless abbreviation, we have CDHSP.  
This is the new one, so I need to update it more.

### Finding a Doctor
The same way you do anything else nowadays.  Research on the internet and ask co-workers if they have someone they particularly like.

##### Anecdote
I started out with a PPO when it was just my wife and myself.  The flexibility was awesome.  However, when the Powers family started to grow we looked at the expense of having our first child and an HMO saved us ~$3k in a single year, so we switched and haven't gone back.

## Dental
Almost everyone has teeth.  Almost all dental plans will not cover you fully for any major problems and your options are limited.  Choose one and it doesn't matter much.
BUT, make sure you start getting dental cleanings every six months.  Dental health is a keystone health issue.  It is predictive and causal for increased problems things like heart disease, stroke and chewing solid food.

## Vision
Much like dental, there aren't any great options and it's just about reducing your overall costs.   The only caveat being if you're going to do something like LASIK.  One of the plans is evidently better than the other, but I'm not, so you're on your own to figure that out.  Once you do, feel free to edit this section.

# Retirement
Saving now will set you up for the future in a way you can't make up for later.  Plus I want you to think nice thoughts about me when you retire.  :)  You especially want to do this due to the [power of compounding](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazing-power-of-compound-interest-2014-7)!  You're young.  Take advantage of that long time horizon to make future you love past you.

I haven't looked in detail recently at what we can do through our plan, but this would be a good way to allocate your investments in the 401k.

* [Boring Videos](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy)

Yes, they're more than a little boring.  Sorry about that.  But I really believe if you follow these concepts you will be super successful financially and prevent people from taking advantage of you in your financial life (and trust me, plenty of people will try).

**Never Forget!**

Investing is ALWAYS going to be trade-off of two things (plus another):
* Risk
* Return

The higher the risk, the greater the potential return, and vise-versa.
If someone tries to sell you something that is low-risk and high return, walk away.

The other thing that also comes into play is liquidity.  In particular think about things like real-estate which can't be quickly sold, versus cash which doesn't need to be sold.

## 401(k)
This is the best corporate investing options.  So named for the portion of the US Tax Code it is defined in, as well as a count of the numbers of reasons you don't care why it's named what it is.
You contribute either pre-tax or post-tax money (more details below) with the earnings on the account growing tax free or tax deferred.
Most companies will match a percentage of your salary.  Regardless of anything else, you should do at least that.
You have the option of a Roth or Traditional 401k.  In general I think a Roth is likely going to work out better because over a long period of time, hopefully you'll retire rich.

* [Reddit 401k Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k)

### Roth vs Traditional
So, which one should you do?  If there were a straightforward answer, the other one would never get mentioned, so it isn't a simple answer.  Essentially what you're trying to figure out is whether or not you'll be in a higher or lower tax bracket when you retire.
#### Traditional
Contributions are pre-tax.  But no one gets away without paying taxes eventually, so you will pay taxes when you withdraw at your tax rate at that time.  (Tax deferred)
* Your bet:  Your tax rate when you retire is going to be lower than your current tax rate.
#### Roth
Contributions are after-tax.  So you've paid your taxes already and you get to withdraw tax free.
* Your bet:  Your tax rate now is lower than it will be when you retire.

Now, there are a few other advantages to a Roth.
* You are not forced to take distributions at 70 1/2 like you are for traditional.  Ok, really, you **are** required to take them if you keep your money in the Roth 401k.  **BUT** if you roll it over into a Roth IRA (why not) it doesn't have this limitation, so you can pass it on to heirs, if you're so lucky.
* You can withdraw your contributions without penalties (but you shouldn't).  Because your money was contributed post-tax, it can be withdrawn without incurring penalties.  At least that's the reason we ascribe to it.  In reality, trying to decipher why anything is anyway in our tax code is a fool's errand.


## Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA)
The above information also applies to IRAs as well, but with further caveats.  Your ability to contribute to an IRA when you also have a work sponsored plan is limited.  They can also be income limited, so pay attention.  This probably falls into the "advanced financial planning" category and beyond the scope of this backgrounder.  You start getting into things like "mega backdoor Roth" which is probably the worst metal band name ever.

## What should I invest in?

You should invest in the assets that aren't going to make you a nervous wreck.  Different people have different tolerances for risk.  
* Index funds

Yes.  These have low fees and if you choose the standard stock indices (S&P500, Large Cap, etc...) they have historically good returns.

* Target date

Also yes.  These work by you setting a date that you expect to want to get the money.  They will automatically rebalance the portfolio over time from high return investments to low risk investments so that you get the advantages of growth with planned stability at the end.
* Low fees

When in doubt, choose the options with low fees.  Fees come straight off of your return.  Thus a fund that is under .25% will perform significantly better than one that is 2% because of math.

### Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)
You should do this!

There may be no such thing as a free lunch, but I'm not sure how much closer this can get.  You enroll and contribute (the maximum you can if you're smart) money for a 6 month period.  At the end of that period you get stock at 85% (or a 15% discount) on the lowest of the price at the beginning or end of the offering period1.   This means you are virtually guaranteed at least a 15% gross return every 6 months and given that it's the lowest, likely even more.  Even at the highest tax rates you'll be over 10% net.  There is nothing else that you can do that is this safe with a return anywhere close.

But!

In order to be smart about this you have to sell immediately!  You already have so much of your financial health tied up in the company, don't be foolish and do it here too.  Take your 15% and invest it in an index or target date fund to diversify.
